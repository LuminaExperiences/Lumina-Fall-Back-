# Custom Frontend Integration Plan for The Big Fake Indian Wedding Ticket System

## Overview
This plan outlines how to integrate a custom frontend (React/Next.js) with your existing Google Apps Script ticket management system while preserving all current functionality.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Google Form** â†’ **Google Sheets** â†’ **Apps Script Processing**
- **Gmail Integration** for Zelle payment verification
- **QR Code Generation** and email delivery
- **Scanner Web App** for event check-ins
- **Automated triggers** for payment monitoring and timeout handling

### Key Components Identified
1. `onFormSubmit(e)` - Main form processing function
2. `checkZelleEmailsAndVerify()` - Payment verification
3. `generateAndSendTickets()` - Ticket generation and delivery
4. `checkInAttendee()` - Scanner functionality
5. Time-based triggers for automation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Apps Script Backend Modifications âœ… COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Add doPost() Endpoint âœ… COMPLETED

The `doPost()` function has been added to your `code.gs` file. This endpoint:
- Accepts JSON POST requests from your custom frontend
- Validates required fields (fullName, email, numTickets, secret)
- Performs security validation using shared secret
- Inserts data into the sheet and triggers existing workflow
- Returns appropriate JSON responses

#### 1.2 Add Helper Functions âœ… COMPLETED

The following helper functions have been added to your `code.gs` file:

- **`getSharedSecret(configSheet)`**: Retrieves the shared secret from Config sheet (cell B3)
- **`insertCustomFormSubmission(...)`**: Inserts form data into the sheet and triggers existing `onFormSubmit` logic

#### 1.3 Configuration Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to add a shared secret to your Config sheet:

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to the "Config" sheet
3. In cell **B3**, enter a strong shared secret (e.g., `my-super-secret-key-2024`)
4. This secret will be used to authenticate requests from your frontend

### Phase 2: Deploy Web App

1. In Apps Script Editor: **Deploy** â†’ **New deployment**
2. Type: **Web app**
3. Execute as: **Me**
4. Who has access: **Anyone** (for public form access)
5. Copy the Web App URL for frontend use

#### 2.1 Test the Endpoint

Test using curl or Postman:

```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEB_APP_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "numTickets": 2,
    "attendeeNamesStr": "John Doe, Jane Doe",
    "screenshotUrl": "",
    "secret": "your-shared-secret-here"
  }'
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

#### 3.1 Next.js Form Component âœ… COMPLETED

A complete React component (`EventTicketForm.jsx`) has been created with:
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Integration with your Apps Script endpoint
- Security token authentication
- User-friendly success/error messages

#### 3.2 Next.js Page âœ… COMPLETED

A complete Next.js page (`page.js`) has been created that:
- Uses the EventTicketForm component
- Provides clear instructions for users
- Explains the registration and payment process
- Includes helpful notes about payment matching

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Apps Script
1. Add your shared secret to Config sheet cell B3
2. Deploy as Web App (Deploy â†’ New Deployment)
3. Set execution as "Me" and access to "Anyone"
4. Copy the Web App URL

### Step 2: Set Up Frontend
1. Create a new Next.js project: `npx create-next-app@latest my-event-form`
2. Install Tailwind CSS: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
3. Copy the provided `EventTicketForm.jsx` and `page.js` files
4. Update the `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` and `SHARED_SECRET` in EventTicketForm.jsx
5. Deploy to Vercel or your preferred platform

### Step 3: Test End-to-End
1. Submit a test form
2. Verify data appears in your Google Sheet
3. Check that existing workflows (email notifications, etc.) still work

## Security Considerations

- Store shared secret in environment variables in production
- Apps Script automatically handles CORS
- Both frontend and backend validation implemented
- Consider rate limiting if needed

## Benefits of This Implementation

âœ… **Zero Backend Migration**: All existing Apps Script logic preserved  
âœ… **Custom UI**: Full control over form design and user experience  
âœ… **Same Data Flow**: Identical sheet structure and processing  
âœ… **Security**: Shared secret prevents unauthorized submissions  
âœ… **Maintainability**: Frontend and backend can be updated independently  

## Files Created

- `code.gs` - Updated with doPost endpoint and helper functions
- `EventTicketForm.jsx` - React form component
- `page.js` - Next.js page implementation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - This comprehensive guide

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Backend modifications completed
2. âœ… Frontend components created
3. ðŸ”„ Deploy Apps Script as Web App
4. ðŸ”„ Set up Next.js project
5. ðŸ”„ Test end-to-end functionality

Your existing Google Forms, Zelle verification, ticket generation, and scanner functionality will continue working exactly as before! ðŸŽ‰
